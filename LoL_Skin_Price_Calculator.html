	// Without their pressure I would be playing this game instead of making stuff
		// A little bit about how this works, or is SUPPOSED to work
		// I have no idea if it works in the way that I want it to, but it gives me the results I want
		// It downloads a file from Riot that lists all current champions
		// Writes down some information, but most of it is unused
		// Then because Riot doesn't want just one big file
		// I have to do some shit in a loop and download all of the other pages
		// The download size is like (champions*20KB) + BigList
		// Almost all of the other data is unused
		// This also causes the webpage to take a while to load
		// But it makes it so I don't need to use my API key at all
		// Now with all the info it downloaded it does whatever I made it do
		// Because at the time I wrote this not it doesnt do much
			// These are some pretty important variables because without these
			// being here javascript would just shit all over me
			// Why cant we have var.global someshithere=3;
